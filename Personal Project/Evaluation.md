# Evaluation

Unfortunately I was sick for almost all of the project’s duration, which meant I was unable to get much further than the concept stage. I was able to do research into the technology that would be required, mostly the speech recognition software, but couldn’t implement much of it. I did however, work out as much of the concept and its intended impact, satirical as it may be, as I could.

Afterwards, I decided to focus on the duo project instead of trying to catch up on my personal one.
