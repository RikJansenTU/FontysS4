# Quick Project Outlines

## Personal Project: Criticmatic
A device that uses speech-to-text to evaluate a piece of literature based on a couple of read sentences.

For more details, see the [Outline](/Personal%20Project/Outline.md), and for an evaluation of the project, see [Evaluation](/Personal%20Project/Evaluation.md).

### Duo Project: A.L.N.D.
A device that automatically shoots cocktail nuts into your mouth, saving you the trouble of grabbing them yourself.

For more details, see the [Outline](/Duo%20Project/Outline.md), and for an evaluation of the project, see [Evaluation](/Duo%20Project/Evaluation.md).

### Client Project: Greenhouse Generative AI Inspiration Room
A room that uses AI generated imagery and sound to empower and inspire imployees of Greenhouse, making them more productive and bringing them to new ideas.
For more details, see the [Outline](/Client%20Project/Outline.md).

# Learning Outcomes

## 1. Vision
> You express your own vision on future scenarios through research of the evolution of mankind’s relationship with technology.

**Duo Project**

The A.L.N.D. was an attempt to highlight the way state-of-the-art technology is used in increasingly useless or niche ways. For more info on how we attempted to express this see [Presentation](/Duo%20Project/Presentation.md).

**Client Project**

(Generative) AI is something I feel very strongly about, both positively and negatively, and I wrote an [essay](/Client%20Project/Vision%20Essay.md) on how I envision AI impacting our society in the future, its potential risks, and how I try to keep that in mind during the project. We also had a discussion with the group where everyone outlined their personal view on the technology.

Based on my views, I try to ensure that the focus of our project is fully on assisting and empowering the Greenhouse employees in any way we can, instead of replacing them.


## 2. Innovative Concept
> You discover and define an innovative concept using creative thinking techniques combined with research of technology, context and human.

**Personal Project**

While it unfortunately never resulted in a functional prototype, I did do extensive research on the technical challenges of this project. Speech-to-text proved an easier challenge than expected, even though I never worked with it before. However, trying to interpret that text in a meaningful way was much more difficult - I could judge words based on how often they appeared in the English language, but attempting to judge an entire sentence was much harder, and resulted in a lot of reading on text interpretation, mostly involving AI.

**Duo Project**

We started this project with an idea for a point we wanted to make, but no specifics in mind, which is why we spent the first week brainstorming and coming up with concepts that could best convey that point. During this project I was less focused on technical research, and more on the human aspect; specifically, how we could best trigger them and get them to think about what we're trying to convey. I looked into other satirical uses of technology, as well as presentation techniques.

**Client Project**

The fact that we didn't receive a clear assignment from Greenhouse was a little bit daunting, but also exciting. Like with the duo project, a lot of the first week was spent brainstorming and coming up with ideas. We started out with general research of what generative AI is and what it can do, and slowly started to narrow down our search, focusing on how we could use it to help Greenhouse. This initial ideation was largely focused on the human side of things; our priority was creating something that genuinely helped Greenhouse employees and corresponded to what they needed, and I believe thanks to that approach we came up with something that genuinely hasn't been done before.

During the project, I also got more and more interested in the societal, cultural, and ethical impact generative AI can have, doing a lot of research into the matter, and writing the aforementioned [essay](/Client%20Project/Vision%20Essay.md).

We also did a lot of user research, and I personally headed the user research into how we could best inspire people, details of which can be found in [Creativity Research](/Client%20Project/Research/Creativity%Research.md).

## 3. Interactive User Experience

> You design an experimental interactive user experience that investigates a technology’s potential and its mutual effect on people.

**Personal Project**

I created a [postcard](/Personal&20Project/Images/Postcard.png) to show off my concept.

**Duo Project**

For our final presentation, based on feedback we got for our previous ones, we tried to make our demo as involved as possible, allowing people to interact with the product directly. I also created a poster where I tried to combine storyboards and 2d renders to give a good overview of our project. For more detailed info, see [Presentation](/Duo%20Project/Presentation.md).

**Client Project**

I am working on 'mood pieces' to show off our concept, as well as a more technical drawing.
 

## 4. Prototypes

> You collaboratively realize and test a series of prototypes and its potential, for both users and stakeholders, in real-world application.

**Personal Project**

I coded simple prototypes to test out speech-to-text functionality, and a couple of iterations of 'algorithms' to interpret the resulting text.

**Duo Project**

While the prototypes never reached the level of fidelity we were shooting for, we did create a multitide of different iterations during the project. We tested accuracy, strength, and reliability with each prototype, and based on the results adjusted our next one. We also tried to improve the visual appeal, making the final prototype more 'loveable'.

**Client Project**

We have performed a multitude of user tests that we are using to refine our prototype; for example, I used the data gathered from the creativity research mentioned before to adjust what images would be generated by the AI in our prototype. For more info see the research [evaluation](/Client%20Project/Research/Evaluation.md).

## 5. Present

> You present your research outcomes, prototypes and reflections in relation to your research, concept and vision, to stakeholders, peers and potential future employers.

**Duo Project**

I created a poster that attempted to not only show a summary of the project, but also the underlying message we wanted to convey. For more detailed info, see [Presentation](/Duo%20Project/Presentation.md).

**Client Project**

We are working on a research document that consolidates all our research in a single file.

For personal reflections, see the Personal Growth learning outcome below.
 

## 6. Personal Growth

> You articulate your professional ambitions and focus and demonstrate your efforts and growth within the roles you fulfil in your projects.

I go over this in [Personal Growth & Challenges](/General/Personal%20Growth%20and%20Challenges.md)
