## Goals

Boiling it down, these are some of the main personal goals I wanted to achieve this semester. Some of these I had in my head at the start, while others emerged over the weeks.

### Combining Creativity and Technology

This goal might seem a bit obvious for a Creative Technology semester, but it was probably the most important issue I wanted to address. A couple of years ago, I started writing and drawing, and it's something I have gotten very passionate about. While I've always been interested in technology, and especially computer science, I didn't really feel this same passion for it. Figuring out a way to overcome a technical obstacle is fun, but just getting a standard assignment didn't make me feel like I could express myself through my work. I recognise that a hobby is probably always going to be more fun than an education or job, but I feel like this creative energy is important enough to me that I'd want to be able to channel some of it into the thing I'll be spending most of my life working with.

The semester definitely gave me some new outlooks on how the field computer science could be approached, and although ironically this differing approach initially made me struggle, I feel like it eventually 'clicked' for me. I don't think I've ever felt as inspired and excited by an assignment as I did with the client project, looking at a problem at a much more conceptual level and using that as a foundation instead of starting out with the technical side.
Technology and creativity had always been largely separate entities in my head, and over the course of the semester I think I learned how to start to combine them. This is definitely an ongoing journey, but I think I've been given some really great tools to continue down this path and continue my development within creative technology.


### Figuring Out What I Want To Do
This goal kind of goes hand in hand with the previous, but is more aimed at the future. Like I said, I have always been interested in computer science, but half a year ago I just couldn't see myself being excited for any job within the field. I didn't really see how I could get enough creative room while still working as a software engineer, but this semester gave me much more perspective - I never even heard the term creative technologist before starting this specialisation.

Most of this goal was accomplished through my search for an internship, which might be cheating slightly. However, now that I had a starting point and a vague idea of what a creative technology career might look like, I was able to find quite a few companies whose work genuinely excited me. Once again, looking for the right career will probably be something I spend many more years doing, but at the very least I now have a starting point, and in February I'll be starting a creative technology internship that I'm very enthusiastic about.


### Experimenting with New Approaches to IT Projects

This is a goal that arose during the course of the semester, once I realised I couldn't simply start programming the way I usually did. 

I'd always enjoyed conceptualising, but actually using it as the base of a project was relatively new. I think the point where it really clicked for me was during the client project, where I headed the user research on creativity. The test had basically nothing to do with computer science, but it was very enjoyable to go from our concept to something that could be tested. Setting up the test brought some new challenges, and once we got the results, figuring out how we could use them to improve our prototype made me much more enthusiastic about the eventual technical implimentation as well.

During my internship I'll have a similar vaguely defined assignment, and I'm really excited to keep working in this manner, and I think everything I learned during this semester will be a great stepping stone.

### Finding a Way to Work With My Limitations

I tend to be incredibly chaotic, in part thanks to my ADHD, which can be a major challenge when working on a large project. I work best when I can just dive into something, but that brings the risk of losing sight of the big picture. I'm very bad at keeping track of all the puzzle pieces involved, and this chaos can sometimes be so overwhelming that I find it difficult to get started on anything at all. I have tried meticulously planning and organising every part of a project, but this just exhausted me more than it helped me. 
I also realised that this chaos can sometimes be a useful tool. It can help me look at problems from creative angles, and come up with ideas other people might not.

This goal is something I've been working on since I started studying, but I definitely made some progress during this semester. Having something that can tracks progress without going into too much detail, like a Trello board, helps me to not lose track of a project. I started keeping simple to do lists (although I still frequently forget to add items to them) that make sure I don't forget any important tasks.
Working in a group definitely helps: it allows me to focus on a single ball for a while instead of having to juggle ten. Discussing general progress with others is also very useful to get a bit more of oversight.

Lastly, although I'm still not entirely happy with our duo project, I think I did learn an incredibly important lesson on sometimes taking a step back to take a look at what you're doing, and evaluate whether or not a different focus might be more fruitful.

## Challenges

There were definitely some challenging (personal) moments during this semester, and unfortunately those did get in the way of my personal development at a few points.

I think I didn't go into this semester in a great state - I didn't get all that much rest during the summer holiday, and was generally stressed, on top of which I got sick very early on. These issues got exacerbated by the fact that I simply had too much on my plate; I was working quite a lot, have a fairly busy social life, and I've always been very bad at saying no to things, even if I don't have the energy to do them. as well as maybe having to do some studying every once in a while. I was also doubting whether or not studying computer science was even what I really wanted, or if it was just the default choice I was sticking to.

Like I mentioned before, I initially found Creative Technology difficult to get into, as it required a bit of a mental switch that I perhaps wasn't quite prepared for. The fact that this specialisation isn't as focused on technical results made it much harder for me to gauge my progress, which brought a lot of self-doubt.

All of this accumulated during the first sprint of the client project, where I just felt completely overwhelmed and exhausted. It took me two weeks to get myself back on track, but I did (hopefully) learn some lessons. I've tried to reprioritise, working less, taking some more time for myself and the things that actually give me energy, and focusing on this semester.

Perhaps finding a way to better balance out the things I want to do in life is a hidden additonal personal goal, because this wasn't the first time I faced these issues and will most likely be something I struggle with in the future. I do think taking a step back helped me get back to work, and I hope I managed to make the most of the last couple of months.

## Looking Back (and Forward)

I'm incredibly grateful to my client project group, and I think they were one of the most important factors in getting me back on track during this semester. I really struggle with letting others know when I'm not doing well, or asking for help, so having a comfortable group that I could get back to and contribute to helped immensely.

Whether or not those contributions end up being enough to pass the semester, I do generally feel better now than a few months ago. I enjoyed working on the client project immensely, and while I didn't learn as many technical skills as I'd expected, I do think I have started looking at computer science in a very different light, something that might be way more valuable. I'm looking forward to my internship, I feel a lot more certain that computer science is what I want to do with my life, and I'm excited to keep exploring creative technology.
