# Personal Growth

## Goals

Boiling it down, these are some of the main personal goals I wanted to achieve this semester. Some of these I had in my head at the start, while others emerged over the weeks.

### Combining Creativity and Technology

This goal might seem a bit obvious for a Creative Technology semester, but it was probably the most important issue I wanted to address. A couple of years ago, I started writing and drawing, and it's something I have gotten very passionate about. While I've always been interested in technology, and especially computer science, I didn't really feel this same passion for it. Figuring out a way to overcome a technical obstacle is fun, but just getting a standard assignment didn't make me feel like I could express myself through my work. I recognise that a hobby is probably always going to be more fun than an education or job, but I feel like this creative energy is important enough to me that I'd want to be able to channel some of it into the thing I'll be spending most of my life working with.

The semester definitely gave me some new outlooks on how the field computer science could be approached, and although ironically this differing approach initially made me struggle, I feel like it eventually 'clicked' for me. I don't think I've ever felt as inspired and excited by an assignment as I did with the client project, looking at a problem at a much more conceptual level and using that as a foundation instead of starting out with the technical side.
Technology and creativity had always been largely separate entities in my head, and over the course of the semester I think I learned how to start to combine them. This is definitely an ongoing journey, but I think I've been given some really great tools to continue down this path and continue my development within creative technology.


### Figuring Out What I Want To Do
This goal kind of goes hand in hand with the previous, but is more aimed at the future. Like I said, I have always been interested in computer science, but half a year ago I just couldn't see myself being excited for any job within the field. I didn't really see how I could get enough creative room while still working as a software engineer, but this semester gave me much more perspective - I never even heard the term creative technologist before starting this specialisation.

Most of this goal was accomplished through my search for an internship, which might be cheating slightly. However, now that I had a starting point and a vague idea of what a creative technology career might look like, I was able to find quite a few companies whose work genuinely excited me. Once again, looking for the right career will probably be something I spend many more years doing, but at the very least I now have a starting point, and in February I'll be starting a creative technology internship that I'm very enthusiastic about.

### Finding a Way to Work With My Limitations
Chaotic, forcing myself to be orderly
Better to pick and choose, bring order to the chaos where needed but embrace it in other aspects

### Experimenting with New Approaches to IT Projects
More conceptual, research based, instead of just technology, more room for creativity
Personal project was really fun, being able to just come up with an idea

## Challenges

Generally being a bit overwhelmed, uncertain, still dealing with some mental hangups
  Not prepared for things not going well
  Trying to go a bit too fast, saying yes to too many things, working too much
  
Initially a difficult semester to get into, results harder to quantify
  
Doubting if this was even what I wanted to do, re examine if this is really where my passion lies or if I'm just doing this because I don't know anything else

## Looking Back (and Forward)

Thanks to the group being able to get back in - struggle with asking feedback when things aren't going well so having a comfortable place helped

Much more comfortable at the end of the project, maybe didn't learn as many technical skills as I hoped but those aren't really that important, really feel like I learned a new way of looking at this field which will prove much more valuable
Looking forward to internship, which has a very similar setup to this semester, applying those same skills I learned here
