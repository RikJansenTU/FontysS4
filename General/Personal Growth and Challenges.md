# Personal Growth

## Goals

Boiling it down, these are some of the main personal goals I wanted to achieve this semester. Some of these I had in my head at the start, while others emerged over the weeks.

### Combining Creativity and Technology

This goal might seem a bit obvious for a Creative Technology semester, but it was probably the most important issue I wanted to address. A couple of years ago, I started writing and drawing, and it's something I have gotten very passionate about. While I've always been interested in technology, and especially computer science, I didn't really feel this same passion for it. Figuring out a way to overcome a technical obstacle is fun, but just getting a standard assignment didn't make me feel like I could express myself through my work. I recognise that a hobby is probably always going to be more fun than an education or job, but I feel like this creative energy is important enough to me that I'd want to be able to channel some of it into the thing I'll be spending most of my life working with.

Like technology, but doesn't feel like a passion like drawing etc does, would like to find something that I actually feel passionate about

### Figuring Out What I Want To Do
Combining creativity with technology
Ongoing journey but at least much more excited for the future

### Finding a Way to Work With My Limitations
Chaotic, forcing myself to be orderly
Better to pick and choose, bring order to the chaos where needed but embrace it in other aspects

### Experimenting with New Approaches to IT Projects
More conceptual, research based, instead of just technology, more room for creativity

## Challenges

Generally being a bit overwhelmed, uncertain, still dealing with some mental hangups
  Not prepared for things not going well
  
Initially a difficult semester to get into, results harder to quantify
  
Doubting if this was even what I wanted to do, re examine if this is really where my passion lies or if I'm just doing this because I don't know anything else

## Looking Back (and Forward)

Thanks to the group being able to get back in - struggle with asking feedback when things aren't going well so having a comfortable place helped

Much more comfortable at the end of the project, maybe didn't learn as many technical skills as I hoped but those aren't really that important, really feel like I learned a new way of looking at this field which will prove much more valuable
Looking forward to internship, which has a very similar setup to this semester, applying those same skills I learned here
