# Personal Growth

## Goals

### Combining Creativity and Technology
Like technology, but doesn't feel like a passion like drawing etc does, would like to find something that I actually feel passionate about

### Figuring Out What I Want To Do
Combining creativity with technology
Ongoing journey but at least much more excited for the future

### Finding a Way to Work With My Limitations
Chaotic, forcing myself to be orderly
Better to pick and choose, bring order to the chaos where needed but embrace it in other aspects

### Experimenting with New Approaches to IT Projects
More conceptual, research based, instead of just technology, more room for creativity

## Challenges

Generally being a bit overwhelmed, uncertain, still dealing with some mental hangups
  Not prepared for things not going well
  
Initially a difficult semester to get into, results harder to quantify
  
Doubting if this was even what I wanted to do, re examine if this is really where my passion lies or if I'm just doing this because I don't know anything else

Thanks to the group being able to get back in

## Looking Back (and Forward)

Much more comfortable at the end of the project, maybe didn't learn as many technical skills as I hoped but those aren't really that important, really feel like I learned a new way of looking at this field which will prove much more valuable
Looking forward to internship, which has a very similar setup to this semester, applying those same skills I learned here
