## A list of changes I've made to my portfolio since last sprint

- The main readme has been updated and clarified across the board.

### Personal Project
- I went into a bit more detail about technical details in the [outline](/Personal%20Project/Outline.md), as well as adding [the code I wrote for it](/Personal%20Project/Algorithm%20Code.md).

### Duo Project
- I wrote a bit on testing and device iteration at [the end of the outline](/Duo%20Project/Outline.md).
- I expanded on the project presentation aspect, moving into a [seperate document](/Duo%20Project/Presentation.md).
