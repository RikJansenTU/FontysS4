## A list of changes I've made to my portfolio since last sprint

- The main readme has been updated and clarified across the board.

### Personal Project

### Duo Project
- I wrote a bit on testing and device iteration at [the end of the outline](/Duo%20Project/Outline.md).

- I updated the [research report on the creativity research](/Client%20Project/Research/Creativity%20Research.md) with some clarification on who did what, as well as some additional pictures of test results.
- I added some [code that randomly added stylistic modifiers to prompts](/Client%20Project/Stylistic%20Randomization%20Code.md).
- I added an addendum about the value of human art, and whether or not AI art could replace it, to my [vision essay](/Client%20Project/Vision%20Essay.md).
