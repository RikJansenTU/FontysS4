# Duo Project

For our Duo Project, Ruben and I created the A.L.N.D.. A.L.N.D. stands for Automatic Long distance Nut Dispenser, a useful device that ensures you never have to get up to eat cocktail nuts ever again. This device will automatically measure the distance to your mouth, and when you open your it the A.L.N.D. will shoot a nut right at you so you can keep doing what you're doing and have a snack at the same time.

## Concepting

We didn’t go into the project with a clear concept of what we wanted to do, so we spent much of the first week coming up with potential ideas. We weren’t looking to create something inherently useful, but instead wanted to create a seemingly useless device that would make people think about some aspect of their lives, akin to an art project. We tried not to get too constricted in technical details immediately, instead throwing out ideas we thought were fun, and worrying about their practical implementation later.

Some of the ideas we ended up rejecting were:

    A device to forcibly remove you from your bed in the morning
    A staircase that could turn into a slide automatically
    A robot that allows you to practice your dating skills
    A drone that follows you around and streams your activities 24/7

Eventually we chose the ALND due to the manageable size of the project, and the fact that it made a funny point about the way advanced technology is being used for more and more mundane tasks, slowly creating a world where we have to do less and less ourselves.

## Technical Challenges

We decided to quickly design a low-fi prototype using rubber bands - we were pretty sure rubber bands would not be used in a final product, but it did allow us to create something that could fire cocktail nuts (albeit inaccurately) and show off our concept. This prototype highlighted initial design flaws and served as a catalyst for new ideas, for example when it came to the shape of the device's 'barrel'.

After an adjusted rubber band-based prototype, we moved on to a spring launching mechanism, which would allow for much greater firing consistency and accuracy. This is where we really started to attempt to dig into the automatic firing mechanism - it would need to be able to pull back the spring a specific amount, and then immediately release it, reloading afterwards. This proved to be a much greater challenge than expected, and while we did do a lot of research into similar devices, we never managed to get a working prototype built.

## Presentation

When we showed our very first prototype, feedback indicated that the satirical nature of the project wasn’t clear, and instead it seemed like our only end goal was to make a functional cocktail nut launcher.

For our final presentation, we wanted to ensure people understood our intentions better, and hopefully make them think about the increasingly large role of technology in our lives. We decided to pretend to ‘sell’ our product, marketing it as a must-have and a truly great use of modern science. We very quickly landed on framing it as an 80s-style Telsel commercial, known for its enthusiastic overselling of incredibly niche or nearly useless items.

We created an advertising poster in this same style, exaggerating the product’s features and framing it as a must-have item, and gave a sales pitch trying to convince the audience to purchase it. We had to make sure to strike a balance between making it straight-faced, but ridiculous enough that people would be able to understand the underlying meaning.

Alongside we set up a demo overselling the complexity of grabbing a cocktail nut for yourself, and offering the A.L.N.D. as a superior alternative, both to mimic the demonstrations often given on Telsel commercials and to make the presentation more hands-on and enjoyable.

Overall, the presentation seemed to have its intended effect; while it might have been a bit on the nose at times, people understood that the project was intended as satire, and the subsequent discussions weren’t about our own device as much as the increasingly minor ‘problems’ in our lives we try to solve with gadgets.
