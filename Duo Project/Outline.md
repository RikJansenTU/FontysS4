# Duo Project

For our Duo Project, Ruben and I created the A.L.N.D.. A.L.N.D. stands for Automatic Long distance Nut Dispenser, a useful device that ensures you never have to get up to eat cocktail nuts ever again. This device will automatically measure the distance to your mouth, and when you open your it the A.L.N.D. will shoot a nut right at you so you can keep doing what you're doing and have a snack at the same time.

## Concepting

We didn’t go into the project with a clear concept of what we wanted to do, so we spent much of the first week coming up with potential ideas. We weren’t looking to create something inherently useful, but instead wanted to create a seemingly useless device that would make people think about some aspect of their lives, akin to an art project. We tried not to get too constricted in technical details immediately, instead throwing out ideas we thought were fun, and worrying about their practical implementation later.

Some of the ideas we ended up rejecting were:

    A device to forcibly remove you from your bed in the morning
    A staircase that could turn into a slide automatically
    A robot that allows you to practice your dating skills
    A drone that follows you around and streams your activities 24/7

Eventually we chose the ALND due to the manageable size of the project, and the fact that it made a funny point about the way advanced technology is being used for more and more mundane tasks, slowly creating a world where we have to do less and less ourselves.

## Technical Challenges

We decided to quickly design a low-fi prototype using rubber bands - we were pretty sure rubber bands would not be used in a final product, but it did allow us to create something that could fire cocktail nuts (albeit inaccurately) and show off our concept. This prototype highlighted initial design flaws and served as a catalyst for new ideas, for example when it came to the shape of the device's 'barrel'.

After an adjusted rubber band-based prototype, we moved on to a spring launching mechanism, which would allow for much greater firing consistency and accuracy. This is where we really started to attempt to dig into the automatic firing mechanism - it would need to be able to pull back the spring a specific amount, and then immediately release it, reloading afterwards. This proved to be a much greater challenge than expected, and while we did do a lot of research into similar devices, we never managed to get a working prototype built.

## Design Iteration

Aside from the firing mechanism, we also spent a lot of time reworking the general shape of the device. The very first never managed to properly launch anything, but after that we set up some tests to measure how accurate and reliable the device was.

Based on the results of these tests, we decided to add a stand so we could more reliably launch from the exact same space, increasing our chances of landing where we wanted, as well as creating a 'locking' mechanism to the spring, so we could always pull it back the exact same distance.
