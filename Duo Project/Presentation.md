## Presentation

When we showed our very first prototype, feedback indicated that the satirical nature of the project wasn’t clear, and instead it seemed like our only end goal was to make a functional cocktail nut launcher.

For our final presentation, we wanted to ensure people understood our intentions better, and hopefully make them think about the increasingly large role of technology in our lives. We decided to pretend to ‘sell’ our product, marketing it as a must-have and a truly great use of modern science. We very quickly landed on framing it as an 80s-style Telsel commercial, known for its enthusiastic overselling of incredibly niche or nearly useless items.

We created an advertising poster in this same style, exaggerating the product’s features and framing it as a must-have item, and gave a sales pitch trying to convince the audience to purchase it. We had to make sure to strike a balance between making it straight-faced, but ridiculous enough that people would be able to understand the underlying meaning.

Alongside we set up a demo overselling the complexity of grabbing a cocktail nut for yourself, and offering the A.L.N.D. as a superior alternative, both to mimic the demonstrations often given on Telsel commercials and to make the presentation more hands-on and enjoyable.

Overall, the presentation seemed to have its intended effect; while it might have been a bit on the nose at times, people understood that the project was intended as satire, and the subsequent discussions weren’t about our own device as much as the increasingly minor ‘problems’ in our lives we try to solve with gadgets.
