# Evaluation

I am incredibly happy with how the project turned out: I think we were able to show a pretty impressive prototype that actually exceeded my initial expectations. I also feel like I learned a lot, in particular some completely new ways to approach projects, and I really enjoyed working together with the rest of our group.
