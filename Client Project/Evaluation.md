# Evaluation

I am incredibly happy with how the project turned out: I think we were able to show a pretty impressive prototype that actually exceeded my initial expectations. I also feel like I learned a lot, in particular some completely new ways to approach projects, and I really enjoyed working together with the rest of our group.

### The End Result

I think we were able to show off quite a lot, and I'm very satisfied with the prototype we created. I also think we made very good use of both our initial concepting and brainstorming as well as the research we did to refine what we had built in the final sprint. We obviously had to pick a couple of aspects to focus on, time being limited, but what we ended up with showed off our concept very well.

If we had more time, we definitely could have kept expanding; I think one of the most interesting things to look into would be ways of making the room more cooperative, something that we found out Greenhouse employees would like based on the interviews we held, but that we didn't have enough time to get into. We also started out with a music angle - this got left by the wayside due to its limited effect on how creatively influenced people felt, but I do think it would be a fun addition that could turn our room more of an experience.

### What I Learned

Something which I had been struggling with the entire semester finally clicked for me during this project, and that was a fundementally different way of approaching projects. In all my previous semesters, the projects were much more defined by the clients. Even when I didn't get a specific assignment, it wasn't really about the impact of a project, but more about what technical skills I could learn from it. Switching to something more concept-based was definitely a challenge.

I tend to have a very chaotic way of working and often struggle to keep an overview of what I'm doing, so switching up the way I approach a problem was maybe more difficult for me than it would be for most. I've always enjoyed coming up with creative ideas, but translating those into a functioning application was more difficult. While I do think I made some steps in learning this in my personal and duo projects, it really clicked for me with this one - going from vague ideas to concepts, using that to set up user research, and finally using the results to adjust our application.

During my internship I am once again going to be working with generative AI, which is exciting. My way of working will also be very similar to this project's, so I'm very excited to continue down this path, and use what I learned during this project as a stepping stone to continue to grow in this direction.

### The Group

Like I said before, I really loved working together with every single person in our group. Everyone was enthousiastic about the project, and willing to take on challenges that they never had before. There was a lot of room for experimentation and new ideas, and everyone got the opportunity to explore avenues they hadn't before, which I think is one of the most important factors that contributed to our success. While we obviously divided the tasks among us, everything was always discussed with the entire group, and everyone was able (and willing) to give advice and constructive critisism.

We had so many discussions, about our project, AI in general, or on other subjects, that it would be impossible to recount all of them in a portfolio. They created an environment that made it incredibly easy to get inspired and come up with new creative ideas and solutions, and many basic concepts got lifted much higher because of this.

I regret that I wasn't at school for 2 weeks during the client project, but when I got back it was very easy to become a part of the project again, and I'm very grateful to the others for that. I hope I managed to contribute as much as I could, and the people in our group were definitely my main motivation to try to make the most of this semester.

Lastly, the group was also just fun to hang around with, which I think is definitely an important aspect. Even if we weren't directly working on anything project-related, we got along well, and the general mood was always friendly and relaxed. I feel very lucky to have been a part of this team.
