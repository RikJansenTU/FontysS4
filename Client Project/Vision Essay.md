# Vision on the Potential Impact of Generative AI on Society

Generative AI is a rapidly evolving technology with potential to revolutionize our society. In essence, it uses artificial intelligence to quickly create vast amounts of content, like music, video, images, text, and more. While this technology provides myriad potential benefits, it also has implications that must be considered. In this essay, I will discuss both the positive potentials and negative consequences of generative AI and discuss how society should address these implications.

### Where are we now, and where are we headed

I believed art would be one of the last things that AI would be able to produce, but programs like Midjourney and Dall-E are now able to make high quality work that (at least at first glance) is difficult to distinguish from human. OpenAI’s GPT-3 is able to produce entire paragraphs of highly specific text based on single-sentence prompt - as a matter of fact, the entire first paragraph of this essay was written, with zero editing on my part, by GPT-3, based only on the prompt _'The introduction to a short essay on the positive and negative consequences of generative AI on society’_.

I see no reason for this rapid innovation to slow down any time soon, especially now that there is such an abundance of public interest. In 10 years, it is very well possible that entire news sites will consist of AI-written articles, concept artists will be completely replaced by engineers feeding an AI prompts, and programmers will no longer be required to write a single line of code by hand.

While this progress is exciting, it is also worrying. I genuinely believe that the advent of AI has the potential to be the biggest upset to societal structure since the industrial revolution, and perhaps beyond, which is why it is vital to examine the potential impact an AI-related project can have.

### The potential

Aside from how exciting AI is from a technology standpoint, I believe one of its biggest strengths lies in its potential to empower people. Those that have ideas in their head but lack the artistic ability to visually express them now have a tool to help them do exactly that. A single person could create entire worlds by just using a simple program, instead of having to spend a small fortune on commissioning artists, a musician could create his perfect album cover, someone from a developing nation could tell their story despite their lack of a formal education, or a writer with dyslexia can finally get his ideas on paper by letting the AI handle the flowery language.

I believe artistic expression is an often-overlooked but vital aspect for anyone’s life, and the more work we can do to lower the barrier of entry, the more people will be able to tap into that aspect of themselves.

Generative AI can be used for more than just art however; to take another example, it can take basic coding tasks out of the hands of developers, leaving them to simply describe the general structure of the software they’d like to create. This can empower a smaller group to create things that would in the past have been far outside of their scope. Our technology is getting increasingly complex, and the teams and budgets required to maintain it at a level that the public has come to expect are getting bigger and bigger, playing right into the hands of the massive corporations slowly swallowing their competitors. AI could give small upstart companies the power to truly challenge those corporations, and create better, more ethical alternatives to their products.

When used right, generative AI has the potential to be an incredible tool, enabling people to dream bigger than they ever could before.

### The danger

‘When used right’ is the key phrase here, however. Like I said before, I believe this technology could create the biggest societal landslide since the industrial revolution. Like that period, AI might very well force people out of their jobs at an unprecedented rate, leaving them struggling to find a replacement. 

Years ago, it was cab and truck drivers who were afraid of losing their jobs to automated driving, but while for those jobs one could make the (questionable) argument that we were simply automating ‘bad’ jobs, this does not apply for artists. Most of them create art because it is their passion, and even if their job mutates from actually creating to generating prompts for an AI it will not give them nearly the same satisfaction. Journalist, writers, concept artists, even some musicians are all in danger of being replaced by a technology that will do their jobs faster, cheaper, and maybe even better, and our current safety net is not adequate to save them from their fall.

What makes things worse, is that these AI models are trained on the work of the very artists it’s threatening to replace, without permission. The models use a large pool of publicly available art to learn how to create, even enabling to mimic the art style of very specific artists - a feat that would be nigh impossible without being trained on that artist’s work. When using DALL-E, following a prompt by the words ‘trending on Artstation’ will generate a piece of art clearly based on the digital art style prevalent on that site. In response, many artists using it have started protesting, claiming they never gave permission for their art to be used.

The potential lack of human oversight is also dangerous - if a news site, set on getting out an article as soon as possible, uses AI to generate it with little actual journalistic input, dangerous situations can be created. An AI model trained using public data can behave in unintended ways, like Microsoft’s chat-bot Tay being taken offline after Twitter trained it to spout hateful statements in under 24 hours. Even if the consequences aren’t directly malicious, bias can creep in in other ways: telling Dall-E to generate a ‘CEO’ will generate a white man in his fifties 9 out of 10 times, simply because of existing stereotypes.

Keep in mind I’m not advocating for banning all generative AI. Even if such a thing were possible, the technology still excites me, and I think it has a lot of potential. Besides, I believe many of the aforementioned issues have solutions. I do however think that the discussion about its potential impact is not being had enough, at least not amongst the people for whom it may be the most important - developers.

### The responsibility

Looking back at the early days of a previous massive technological shift - the creation of the internet - it is clear that the initial focus lay mostly on how exciting the tech was, and not how it could be misused. While we’re now finally getting around to erecting some safety barriers, a lot of people have gotten hurt because of this lack of consideration. We’re still in the progress of truly getting started on this AI journey, and now is the time to think about its impact.

While I am a believer in government oversight, we all know governments can be slow and less than tech-savvy. The law will most likely be playing catch-up with technology for the foreseeable future, which means the responsibility lies largely with the developers involved. We (and I do see myself as part of this group) need to not only consider ways to advance and use AI, but also what impact, either positive or negative, can have. We need to ensure that we give people power, instead of taking it away from them. This is especially important because we are in a privileged position; not only do we have more control over the directions AI take, but we’re also little at risk of being impacted negatively. Even the models generating code will not impact us, but mostly people less privileged, or in developing countries, who make a living writing exactly the type of code generative AI specializes in.

This is by no means an easy task, but one that is vital to consider, especially when working with technologies as potentially disruptive as generative AI.

### The project

As you might be able to tell by the length of this essay, this subject is one I feel strongly about, which is why I was excited to be able to apply some of it in our own project. I think it’s incredibly important to create something that helps and empowers people, and luckily with the direction we’re currently taking we can do exactly that. We have, within our group, discussed our visions on the future and impact of generative AI, and while most others in the group have a much more positive outlook, we do find it important to keep thinking about these issues.

Our mission statement is to empower employees. Empower is a word that I’ve used before, and one that I think is very important. I think it’s important that we don’t try to replace employees, or force them to fundamentally change the way they work, but to give them additional tools to add to their arsenal. This is why the user has been front in center throughout the project so far.

We have performed a variety of user research, largely focused on how we can best inspire and assist people in their work. We tried to figure out what inspired people, and how we could influence their emotions in a positive way to make them more productive, and based much of our direction on the results.

We also interviewed Greenhouse employees. I think it’s incredibly important to involve the people in whose playground you’re playing, and by getting input from the creatives at Greenhouse we could make sure to keep their wishes in mind. Once again, it’s about empowering them, giving them tools, not replacing them. Based on their feedback we are currently looking into ways to make the room more of a group experience, considering 

We kept the interviews deliberately focused, but in the future, and especially if we wanted to expand our project’s scope, I think these kind of roundtables would become even more vital, involving the people we’re impacting every step of the way. I’m not only talking about practical details, but potentially informing people on the technology and investigating their hopes and fears. 

Making sure we keep the human being in mind is, in my opinion, the best way to innovate with this exciting new technology in ways that help, instead of hinder.

## Addendum: The Artistic Value of AI Art

_Saturn Devouring His Son by Francisco Goya_

Something I've only touched on briefly is the value and meaning behind art. This is an incredibly complex discussion that I can't even start to get into properly here, but it's one that has preceded the emergence of AI by many years. Critiques of modern art will pop up occasionaly, with people asking themselves how a completely blue canvas can possibly be construed as 'art' - but without getting into that discussion I think most people will agree that there is art out there that is deeply meaningful.
Much of that meaning is derived less from the technical skills required to create a piece of art, but more about the feelings and intentions behind it. Good art can be a window into someone's soul, and when an artist puts a piece of themselves into what they create, they sometimes manage to translate that piece onto the viewer. Will AI ever be able to create anything as horrific as Goya's _Saturn Devouring His Son_, as vengeful as Gentelischi's _Judith Beheading Holofernes_, or as tragic and grief-filled as the Mount Eerie album _A Crow Looked At Me_, without being able to experience the deeply impactful life experiences and emotions those artists did?

There is actually a philosophical definition of _bullshit_: it's something produced without particular concern of truth, to distinguish from a deliberate, manipulative lie intended to subvert the truth. I think this is a definition that very much applies to AI generated art, as least as we know it now. The AI 'knows' what it is depicting, and can emulate styles, but there is no intention behind it. Without a human being the work itself is completely empty, devoid of meaning - literally bullshit.

_Judith Beheading Holofernes by Artemisia Gentileschi_

I think this is also noticeable for those consuming the art; while I've seen some very impressive pieces generated by AI, none of them have ever had the same impact or evoked the same amount of thought as a 'real' piece of art could. 
I do think it's possible for an artist to use AI to create a finely tuned piece that does convey part of them, but at this point the AI is no more than a tool, not unlike photoshop or even a simple paintbrush. The truth still comes from human experience. 

Will an AI ever be able to create anything meaningful? The boring but thruthful answer is I don't know. I do think it's something that, even with the rapid progress these algorithms are making, is far in the future. Maybe I'm looking at this with slightly romanticised glasses, and overestimating how hard it is to fake meaning, I like to think that art (whatever form it takes) is possibly the most important indicator of intelligence in sentient being. If AI wants to create something that isn't bullshit, it'll need to learn how to think first.
