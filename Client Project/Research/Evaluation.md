While I definitely expected the AI generated imagery to have a positive effect on ideation, I didn't expect it to be quite so pronounced. The drawings people made proved quite a good way to quantify something as vague as 'creativity', but being able to see what elements they added to their second concept, and how often they directly corresponded to elements in the AI images, really helped pin down which images served as the best inspiration
