# Research - Using AI Generated Content to Increase Creativity
The goal of this user research is twofold: first, to prove that AI generated imagery and sound are capable of inspiring people and bringing them to new ideas. Second, to investigate what type of imagery and sound exactly is the most effective at inspiring people and bringing them to new ideas. 

## Methodology 

We conducted our testing as follows: first we gave people the prompt ‘rocket’ and asked them to draw a related concept on a piece of paper in 1.5 minutes. Then we showed them  AI generated images, manually pre-generated beforehand, as well as playing AI generated music. Afterwards we asked them to once again draw a concept related to the ‘rocket’ prompt in 1.5 minutes. We finally interviewed them, asking them what images, if any, inspired them or gave them new ideas, as well as how the music affected them.

## Results 

20 out of 20 subjects drew a rocket for their first concept, but after seeing and hearing the AI content 19 of them created an adjusted second concept. 

Out of 20 subjects, 17 stated the images helped them come up with additional ideas. The remaining 3 didn't feel like the images helped them in any way, although all 3 stated that they didn't feel like any kind of image would have been useful.

### Most Helpful Images 

The AI generated images are categorised in 3 major groups:  

1. Pictures containing rockets 

2. Pictures that do not contain any rockets but show adjacent concepts, like astronauts, space, or aliens 

3. Pictures that are completely unrelated, like a beach or a jungle 

7 people stated the pictures from group 1 inspired them, helping them visualise what a rocket could look like. This often resulted in a more detailed drawing of a rocket, often with added features. 

13 people stated the pictures from group 2 inspired them, bringing them to additional ideas aside from simply drawing a rocket. This often resulted in them focusing their efforts more on elements surrounding the rocket, like a background. 

Only 1 person stated the pictures from group 3 inspired them, changing the background of their concept to a beach thanks to a specific image. 

 

### Differences in Second Concept 

When looking at people's second concept, the difference is clear.  

Out of 20, 7 people adjusted or added to the details of their rocket, adding features like additional boosters or wings, or showing a better grasp of its general structure and shape. 

12 people added more details to the rest of their concept, often adding a background where there wasn't one before, or adding related concepts like a space-walking astronaut. Many of these elements the subjects linked to specific images, like coming up with the idea for an added alien after seeing an image of one. 

4 people decided to make stylistic changes to their second concept as a result of seeing the images, for example changing their overall style to be more cartoony or adding more colour. 

2 people completely changed their second concept. One of them decided to go with a fireworks rocket, an idea triggered by a picture of fireworks, and the other, triggered by images of military rockets, drew the Iron Giant flying through space.

### Music 

Unfortunately, we didn't manage to get much useful data regarding the musical aspect of the tests. Due to some technical issues, we weren't able to play the music during every single test, and we got very little meaningful information from the people who did hear the music. I do believe music can play a vital role in inspiring people and has a place in this project, but it's much harder to quantify, and because of the lack of data I am not willing to make any conclusions. Further, more specialised testing would be required to properly investigate music’s role. 

 

## Discussion 

The results clearly show that AI generated imagery is capable of inspiring people.  

It should be noted that a certain amount of difference between the two concepts would have occurred even without seeing any images. Simply asking people to design the same concept twice would most likely often result in an improved second draft, thanks to the visualization and practice gained by creating the first. We do however believe that the images helped greatly with giving people new ideas. 

Another interesting observation is that the result of the images seems to have a greater effect on those that came up with a more creative or expressive first concept. For those who struggled with their first concept, the images helped them visualise and focus on what they wanted to create for their second concept, but the overall changes were more subtle. Often, when their first concept was a drawing of a rocket, the second one would be too. 

The effects were much more noticeable when it came to those who were able to express more creativity in their first concept. Often, the images inspired them to drastically change their composition, art style, or even subject matter. This makes sense, as people who are more (visually) creative in the first place will be more accustomed to quickly creating new associations based on reference material. 

These results are exciting, especially considering our target audience. The base concept of the project works, especially when it comes to more creative people – exactly the people we are targeting. 

 

### Future Steps 

Most importantly, these results also give us great insights in what imagery works best to spark new ideas and inspire people, which will be very useful in adjusting the prompts we use to generate images for our prototypes. Completely unrelated images don't seem to be of much help, so our focus should be on generating imagery that either directly displays a prompt, or that shows things very closely related, without necessarily containing the prompt itself. 

Diversifying the images’ art style seems to serve as an additional source of inspiration, and considering that generative AI is quite good at consistently mimicking specific art styles this will be something well worth investigating further.
